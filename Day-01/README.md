```python
    atuple = (""continet",7,["states"]")
    btuple = [1,2,3,4]
    ctuple = ("name","subjects","marks")
    dlist = ("python",[1,"street name", "city name"])
```
- dictionary : _Dictionary is a key-value pair store. 'key' is Unique and 'value' can be anything.'Key' must immutable datatype like string,number or tuple_
```python
 adict = {a  = "name",b = "roll number",c = {"address"},d=[23,45,83,100]}
```
- set : _set is unordered collections of unique elements_
```python
aset = {"a","e","i"}
bset = {"i","o","u"}
cset = {20,12,16,20}
dset = {3,1,20,30}
```
